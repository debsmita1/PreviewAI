# PreviewAI üîçü§ñ

*A lightweight AI-powered code review assistant for your PRs*

PreviewAI runs on your **staged changes** or **last commit** and generates **actionable AI suggestions** before you open a Pull Request. With PreviewAI, you can tailor reviews to your specific tech stack, enforce team conventions, and even run everything locally using your local LLM. Think of it as an **AI-powered pre-PR code reviewer** that helps you catch potential improvements earlier, making the PR review process faster.

Note: It‚Äôs not meant to replace your existing AI coding assistants; instead, it works as a complementary tool for teams who want deeper control, and customizability in their review process.

Example custom-prompt.json

```custom-prompt.json
{
  "prompt: {
    "reviewerRole": "Senior Frontend Engineer",
    "reviewCriteria": "Focus on code quality, performance, security, and maintainability. Flag common pitfalls such as missing null checks, unhandled promises, or unnecessary re-renders in React.",
    "testCriteria": "Generate Jest + React Testing Library tests for new features and edge cases.",
    "outputFormat": "Structure review output as: 1. High Priority Issues 2. Medium Priority Issues 3. Low Priority Issues 4. Suggested Test Code",
    "otherNotes": "Pay special attention to performance optimizations and security best practices.",
  },
  "dataMineContext": {
    "remoteUrl": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
    "githubToken": "ghp_your_github_token",
    "maxExamples": 200
  }
}

```

#### Examples

```
# Review with a custom prompt
npm run review -- --repo ~/Documents/community-plugins --prompt <path-to>/custom-prompt.json
```

If `dataMineContext` is set, PreviewAI will fetch and cache` your team‚Äôs past review comments from GitHub and use them as few-shot examples, making the AI naturally align with the review style.
